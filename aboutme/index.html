        Hey there! I'm Adam Petersen, if you couldn't tell by the title above this.
        I got off of my mission in Wichita, Kansas about 4 months ago now, so I'm going to college to get more knowledge!
        To be specific, knowledge about Software Engineering, which is my major.

        Honestly I've mostly just been working these past months,
        but when I'm not doing work I really enjoy swimming, singing, playing board/video games, playing piano, and hanging out with friends!
        Right now life's been pretty crazy, so there hasn't been a ton of room for things like that,
        but I'm excited to get into my classes and learn more about my field of work! Computers have so much potential, and I'm excited to be a small part of the advances and applications of technology coming soon!
